## What are we working on?
<p> A Food delivery app, connecting restaurants with customers via web and mobile apps</p>

<P>Key assets</P>

- Customer data, payment info
- Restaurant partner info
- Delivery tracking info

<p> Prioritizing risks </p>

- Medium risk would be Related on something about the food like delivery tracking.

- Low risk would be something minor like marketing data breach.

## What are we going to do about it?
M - Mitigate so encrypt data , using secure APIS
E - Eliminate unneccessary stored data
T - Transfer Use cyber insurance, outsource payments
A - Accept low impact losses
- Other mentions - patching regularly
## Did we do a good enough job

- Train employees on potential risks and threaths
- Monitor potential breaches and be ready for anything
- Regural audits and pentests

<p> I think we did a good job of applying securtiy measures for a  app that sotres a lot of customer data including addresses and payment infos. We just need to be careful of poachers trying to poach customer info and data. Our priority is the customers safety and i think we deliver it every time. </p>
