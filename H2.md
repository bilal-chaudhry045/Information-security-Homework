# h2 Kill Chain 
## x)
### - Cyber Kill chain can be explained as the process in which attackers carry out cyberattacks
### - Lockheed martin introduced a guide that shows the steps involved in a cyberattack. Failure at any step breaks the cyberattack
### - F2T2EA is a U.S. Air Force kill chain model that stands for Find, Fix, Track, Target, Engage, and Assess
### - Adaptation for cyber intrusions :  Focus on developing a payload, breaching a trusted boundary, establishing presence, and pursuing objectives.
### - Phases involved in the kill chain include : reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command & control, actions on objectives
### Note (We went through these definitions on the lesson so i wont go into them now).
## Question ...
### - Which is phase is the most crucial since the chain can be disrupted in any stage? or are they all equally important?

## a) Tactics, tools and procedures
### Tactic
### - The tactic is the why, so goal or the reason for taking action, it explains what the attacker is trying to accomplish.
### Example : A attacker might want long term access to systems or basically anything that the kill chain can be implented into.


### Technique 
### - Technique is the how, so how the attacker attempts to achieve the goal.
### Example : A technique that can be used might be gathering intelligence on the victim, or credential dumping so stealing someones password and with the intention to perform malitious activites.


### Sub-technique
### - Sub-technique is a more detailed reason of how the attacker performs the technique, Different sub-techniques include : Hardware, Software, Firmware and Client configurations.
### Example : So lets say in credential dumping, attackers can do this by accessing memory LSASS, system databases or registry hives.

### Procedure 
### - Procedures are real-world applications of techniques and sub-techniques. They represent the specific ways attackers put these methods into practice.
### Example : One cool example if found is something called Procdump.exe the attacker uses this to create a memory dump of the LSASS process, then extracts plaintext credentials. (Plaintext is  Usernames and passwords that are stored or sent in plain, unencrypted text. Almost the same as leaving your password on a sticky note infront of your computer) = very risky.
