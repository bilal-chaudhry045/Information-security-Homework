## A01:2021 – Broken Access Control
### * Broken Access control lets attackers act outside intended permissions for example url tampering or privilege escalation this leads to unauthorized data access.
### * We can orevent this by enforcing strict server side checks, deny by default and centralized access control 
### * Question : What would happen if access control is only checked every day by the developers.

## A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration
### * Security flaws occur when systems ar misconfigured : default passwords , unnecessary features, verbose error messages, missing security headers , insecure cloud settings, or the software is out of date. 
### * This can be prevented by hardening and automating configuration, removing unnecessary components, keeoing settings consistent across different platforms, but mainly reviewing  and patching security settings.
### * question : what would happen if we forget to change a default password.

## A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components 
### * Means using old and unsupported libraries, frameworks , OS , DB , APIs can let attackers exploit easily and known flaws.
### * We can prevent this by updating and patching regurarly and removing unused cmponents and monitoring vurnebilities continuously.
### * What is the easiest component to exploit ? 

## A03:2021 – Injection
### * Injection happens when user input is used unsafely in commands or queries SQL, NoSQL, OS, LDAP, ORM, letting attackers read, modify, or delete data.
### * We can prevent this by using parameterized queries or safe APIs , validating input, and escaping data properly; review code and test all input points.
### Question : what would happen if user input is directly added to a database query?

### Exploits of a mom : shows a student named Robert’); DROP TABLE Students;– causing a SQL injection that deletes the school’s student database. It shows why we shoould validate and sanitize user input to prevent similart attacks.

## e) (UPDATE 27.9.2025 SEE BELOW REPORT)
### Instructions very unclear, didnt even know if this was legal to inject but hypthetically if i would have done it here are the steps.
### 1. Go to developer tools and go to network
### 2. then go to product category in the lab UI so that i can generate the request
### 3. In network click the request then go to locate and there should we be something we can edit
### 4. edit the text and replace it with ' OR 1=1 -- AND CLICK SEND
### This would be steps i would take.
