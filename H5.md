## â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations
### * Sender encrypts a message so that the receipient can read it securely preventing any eavesdropping from nosy people.
### * encryption = converting plaintext into ciphertext through encryption to secure a message
### * Decryption = encryption reversed to read a message.
### * Cryptography secures a message and cryptoanalysis tries to break them

## PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
### Shows instructions to send an ecnrypt messages and exchanging public keys.
### GPG to encrypt and sign messages, makes sure that its confidnetial and authentic
### Generate key pairs and exchange public keys in a secure manner to ensure trust between two people.

## A) (UPDATE 27.9.2025 SEE BELOW REPORT)
### First i started by installing ssh server.

### I tried to connect using ssh client from my macs terminal to the debian vm but it wouldnt let my connect it even though i put in the correct password and tried multiple times

## B) (UPDATE 27.9.2025 SEE BELOW REPORT)
### Since i wasnt able to connect my mac to the debian via ssh i cant really do this but i was able to generate a public and private key on my debian. i used  ssh keygen to generate them.

## C) (UPDATE 27.9.2025 SEE BELOW OF THE REPORT)
### In the terminal i installed keePassXC its one of the most common password managers.
### installed it using sudo apt install keepassxc -y
### <img width="543" height="451" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e3a8b98-6ecc-4a58-b3bb-08d4a4c48f38" />
### * This also showed me errors in which i couldnt get it installed but if i would have wouldve created a new entry and generated a new password
## Why a password manager is needed ? 
1. Mainly to store and protect your passwords
2. you dont need to reuse old weak passwords you can create new stornger passwrds
3. you become less prone to phishing attacks
4. reduces risk of forgetting passwords by storing them in a secure database.


## r) Voluntary bonus
### * Transport Layer Securtiy TLS is a protocol that provied secure communication between a web browser and a server. It encrypts data which is relevant for this homework
### TLS certfiicate = Lets encrypt is a certificate authority that secures websites.
### * Key fields of a TLC certificate inlucde : 
1. Common name = domain name the certificate protects
2. Public key used for encrypting communication 
3. signature algorithm
4. validity period
### A broweser knows that it is legit by checking the certificate is signed by a trusted CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY.
### And also by verifying that the domain name matches the common name and that it is in the validity period.

### Who says its legit ? - Cerfiticate authorities for example Lets encrypt.

# UPDATES TO REPORT Updates were all made 27.9.2025
## Update A)
* So after downloading and researching i found that i had done this completely wrong
* These are the steps i took
1. Sudo apt-get update to update apps that are available
2. Then sudo apt install openssh-client and then sudo apt install openssh-server
<img width="694" height="519" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2883e44-7174-43ae-86f6-585def1e8b09" />
* i already had the latest version installed.

3. then i connected it using ssh localhost
4. then ssh-keygen to generate the public key <img width="687" height="498" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ac3f5556-bd67-4dd4-9161-57be70fbfb07" />
5. then i copied to my localhost and connected it again and now it doesnt need my password
   <img width="1213" height="465" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71d14b11-f6aa-4d18-9b2e-8feb0ed3f9da" />

## Update C)
* So first i downloaded keypassxc on my debian 12 and i got no errors.
* i used sudo apt-get update and then sudo apt install keypassxc
* <img width="825" height="691" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad370332-ed6f-4de4-8f7a-58c3fb2ca539" />
* you could create a new database and confgiure the settings of said database
  <img width="828" height="628" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a050ef2-959b-4f36-806b-03313e6dfd6d" />
* this is the main area of the app here you can manage databases create new ones and maange your passwords in a database.
* also they allow you to generate passwords
* Other info that i put on the C part remains the same so the why is a password manager needed.
