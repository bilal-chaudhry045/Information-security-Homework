## â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: Chapter 1: Foundations
### * Sender encrypts a message so that the receipient can read it securely preventing any eavesdropping from nosy people.
### * encryption = converting plaintext into ciphertext through encryption to secure a message
### * Decryption = encryption reversed to read a message.
### * Cryptography secures a message and cryptoanalysis tries to break them

## PGP - Send Encrypted and Signed Message - gpg
### Shows instructions to send an ecnrypt messages and exchanging public keys.
### GPG to encrypt and sign messages, makes sure that its confidnetial and authentic
### Generate key pairs and exchange public keys in a secure manner to ensure trust between two people.

## A)
### First i started by installing ssh server.

### I tried to connect using ssh client from my macs terminal to the debian vm but it wouldnt let my connect it even though i put in the correct password and tried multiple times

## B)
### Since i wasnt able to connect my mac to the debian via ssh i cant really do this but i was able to generate a public and private key on my debian.

## C) 
### In the terminal i installed keePassXC its one of the most common password managers.
### installed it using sudo apt install keepassxc -y

### * This also showed me errors in which i couldnt get it installed but if i would have wouldve created a new entry and generated a new password
## Why a password manager is needed ? 
1. Mainly to store and protect your passwords
2. you dont need to reuse old weak passwords you can create new stornger passwrds
3. you become less prone to phishing attacks
4. reduces risk of forgetting passwords by storing them in a secure database


## r) Voluntary bonus
### * Transport Layer Securtiy TLS is a protocol that provied secure communication between a web browser and a server. It encrypts data which is relevant for this homework
### TLS certfiicate = Lets encrypt is a certificate authority that secures websites.
### * Key fields of a TLC certificate inlucde : 
1. Common name = domain name the certificate protects
2. Public key used for encrypting communication 
3. signature algorithm
4. validity period
### A broweser knows that it is legit by checking the certificate is signed by a trusted CERTIFICATE AUTHORITY.
### And also by verifying that the domain name matches the common name and that it is in the validity period.

### Who says its legit ? - Cerfiticate authorities for example Lets encrypt.
