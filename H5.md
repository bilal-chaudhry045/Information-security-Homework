### * This also showed me errors in which i couldnt get it installed but if i would have wouldve created a new entry and generated a new password
## Why a password manager is needed ? 
1. Mainly to store and protect your passwords
2. you dont need to reuse old weak passwords you can create new stornger passwrds
3. you become less prone to phishing attacks
4. reduces risk of forgetting passwords by storing them in a secure database
