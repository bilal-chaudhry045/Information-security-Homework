## Cant fish 

### First i shut down the network on my VM. Then i tried to send a ping with the command line ping 1.1.1.1. But since there is no network the system said "ping: connect: Network is unreachable".
### The ping command is a tool used to check if the computer can reach another computer over the network but since we shut it down it couldnt
### 1.1.1.1 is the IP address of Cloudflares DNS server.

## Local only

### First i started by disconnetcting my computer from the internet
### Then i installed nmap with the command line "sudo apt-get install nmap"
### Then i used this command line "sudo nmap -A localhost", sudo = run as administrator, nmap = the port scanning tool , -A enables advanced features such as OS detection, scrpit scanning. localhst = targeting my own computer.

### Results = In my computer there were 999 closed tcp ports.
### If the port is open, then that means it tries to find an connection and is usable.

## Daemon

### First i used commands form Teros website, sudo apt-get update which updates the packages and sudo apt-get -y install apache2 to install the daemon.
### Then i disconnected from the internet. 
### Command to start the daemon was "sudo systemctl start apache2".
### Then run the port scan command with apache running in the back "sudo nmap -A localhost"
### Now when using daemon there was a new open port 80/tcp (HTTP) = This is Apache web server.
### So installing and running a daemon like apache adds a new open port to your computer.

### Explain like im five = Imagine a house and you haave 3 doors and after you installed Apache which opened a new door.

## OverTheWire 

### Level 0: I connected to the Bandit server via SSH, listed the directory contents using ls, and then used cat to read the readme file.
### Level 1: The file was named with a -, so I referenced it using ./- and opened it with cat.
### Level 2: This time the filename contained spaces, so I enclosed the name in quotes and used cat to read it.
### Level 3: I navigated into the inhere directory with cd, then ran find to locate hidden files. After finding them, I used cat to check their contents.
### Level 4: Again, I moved into the inhere directory. This time I manually opened each file with cat until I found the one that contained the password.
