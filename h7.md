## x) â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
## 2.3 One-way functions
### - one way functions are important to public cryptography
### - the way it works is it takes a message, encrypst it and then gives it to the person receiving it with no way to crack it
### - trapdoor one way function is one way for the recipient to maybe decrypt the message.
## 2.4 One-way hash functions	
### - one way hash function takes a variable length input and makes it into a fixed length output
### - it only works in one direction
### - they should be collision free so its hard to generate two pre images with the same hash value.
### - its public
## a) 

### * This was straight forward i followed teros instructions
1. sudo apt-get update
2. sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget
3. then created a new directory you can see it in the screenshot as 'hashed'
4. then downloaded the big dictionary provided in the instructions then checked it 'head rockyou.txt' and 'wc -l rockyou.txt'
5. got it to work

### * pretty straightforward
## b)

### * next i was able to crack the hash using the instructions tero provided, this first picture shows the status of the hash as cracked.
  1. i used 'hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df'
  2. then i used the MD5 its probably the most common with hashcat -m0
  3. then i used hashcat -m 0 'd595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df' rockyou.txt -o solved
  4. and it showed me the status and just analytics of cracking the hash
  5. what i found interesting was that it shows the range of candidates being tested
  6. i used this command hashcat -m 0 --show hash.text; and it showed me the real plaintext which is DISOBEY.

### * And i assume this is the correct one
