## x) â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
## 2.3 One-way functions
### - one way functions are important to public cryptography
### - the way it works is it takes a message, encrypst it and then gives it to the person receiving it with no way to crack it
### - tarpdoor one way function is one way for the recipient to maybe decrypt the message.
## 2.4 One-way hash functions	
### - one way hash function takes a variable length input and makes it into a fixed length output
### - it only works in one direction
### - they should be collision free so its hard to generate two pre images with the same hash value.
### - its public
## a) 

### * This was straight forward i followed teros instructions and got it installed

### * pretty straightforward
## b) 

### * next i was able to crack the hash using the instructions tero provided, this first picture shows the status of the hash as cracked.

### * what i found interesting was that it shows the range of candidates being tested

### * then i ran this command hashcat -m 0 --show hash.text; and it showed me the real plaintext which is DISOBEY.

### * And i assume this is the correct one
