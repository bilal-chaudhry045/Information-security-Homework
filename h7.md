## x) â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
## 2.3 
### * one way functions = easy to compute but hard to reverse
### * cryptographic rule is used in  public key cryptography and digital signatures and password protections.
### * trapdoor functions are reversible with only special info.
### * examples are multiplying primes vs factoring.
## 2.4
### * one way hash functions are able to map data of any size to a single fixed output.
### * key properties include : pre-image resistance , second pre-image resistance and collision resistance
### * used in data integrity digital signature, password storage and some examples include MD5, SHA -1
## a) 
### * This was straight forward i followed teros instructions and got it installed

### * pretty straightforward
## b) 
### * next i was able to crack the hash using the instructions tero provided, this first picture shows the status of the hash as cracked.
### * what i found interesting was that it shows the range of candidates being tested

### * then i ran this command hashcat -m 0 --show hash.text; and it showed me the real plaintext which is DISOBEY.

### * And i assume this is the correct one
