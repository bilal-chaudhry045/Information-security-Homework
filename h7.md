## x) â‚¬ Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
## 2.3 One-way functions
### - one way functions are important to public cryptography
### - the way it works is it takes a message, encrypst it and then gives it to the person receiving it with no way to crack it
### - they are simple to compute one way but hard to reverse

## 2.4 One-way hash functions	
### - one way hash function takes a variable length input and makes it into a fixed length output
### - its easy to compute hash but it would be very hard to return the input back 
### - they should be collision free so its hard to generate two pre images with the same hash value.
### - its public

## A and B) installing hashcat and testing a hash and cracking the hash
### First i update my linux like it said in the instructuons and then proceeded to install the hashcat by using . sudo apt-get -y install hashid hashcat wget .

### Then i created a new directory for our stuff and a big dictionary.

### I used this command to crack them
### first one : hashid -m 6b1628b016dff46e6fa35684be6acc96 
### second one : hashid -m d595b2086532422bbe654bc07ea030df

###  i cracked the hashes for me it shows both of them because i had done the first one before but then i realized that i needed to crack the one in the example aswell and then naturally it was saved and it shows both of them when use 'cat solved'

### after using the hashid -m "hash" i used the cat solved to show the solved plaintext. 
### So the first hash is = Summer
### And the second hash is = Disobey

## In conclusion i just followed the instructions step by step and everything worked as should.
