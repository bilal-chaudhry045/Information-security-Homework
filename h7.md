## x) € Schneier 2015: Applied Cryptography: 2.3 One-Way Functions and 2.4 One-Way Hash Functions.
## 2.3 One-way functions
	•	One-way functions are a fundamental building block in public-key cryptography, not full protocols themselves.
	•	They transform input into an output that’s easy to compute but infeasible to reverse.
	•	Because they can’t be inverted, additional mechanisms are required.
	•	Trapdoor one-way functions solve this: someone with secret “trapdoor” information can invert the function to recover the message.

## 2.4 One-way hash functions
	•	One-way hash functions map variable-length input to a fixed-size digest.
	•	They’re easy to compute but hard to invert (finding a pre-image for a given hash).
	•	Collision resistance is desired: it should be hard to find two inputs with the same hash.
	•	The algorithm is public; security depends on computational difficulty, not secrecy.
## a) 

### * This was straight forward i followed teros instructions and got it installed

### * pretty straightforward
## b) 

### * next i was able to crack the hash using the instructions tero provided, this first picture shows the status of the hash as cracked.

### * what i found interesting was that it shows the range of candidates being tested

### * then i ran this command hashcat -m 0 --show hash.text; and it showed me the real plaintext which is DISOBEY.

### * And i assume this is the correct one
